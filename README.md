# AM-Signal-Encoding-Decoding

One-line description: A C++ program for generating and demodulating amplitude-modulated (AM) signals based on ASCII characters using frequency shift keying.

Summary: This C++ program generates amplitude-modulated (AM) signals for encoding ASCII characters, specifically using frequency shift keying (FSK) with two different frequencies representing binary zeros and ones. The `generateAMBit` function creates a signal for a single bit by modulating a carrier frequency with either of two modulation frequencies based on the bit value, within a given bit duration. The `generateAMSignalForLetter` function encodes a whole ASCII character into an AM signal by iterating over each bit of the character and generating its corresponding AM signal. It returns the modulating signal for each bit, facilitating later analysis or processing. The `demodulateAMSignal` function extracts ASCII characters from the modulated signal by averaging the modulated signal's samples over each bit's duration and determining the predominant frequency, thereby decoding the signal back into characters. This program illustrates a fundamental digital communication method and includes an example main function that demonstrates encoding and recovering a character.
